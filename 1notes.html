    <p>So first of all in the first lecture we have studied about how internet works and it works like we as a client makes a request on the browser which further goes on ISP or you can say our internet service provider and then our request goes in the dns server which looks in it database that wha is the exact ip address we are looking for and then the dns send all the files present at thst ip address back to the client.</p>
    <p>And in the next lecture how websites works and in order to access a webpage we need a browser and we look up IP address of webpage on the webbrowser.</p>
    <p>Then we discussed about HTML language and some resources where we can study the documentation like w3schools, mdn,devdocs.io, and also seen a platform where we can code for some short things like codepen.io</p>
    <p>Then we have seen some attributes like heading and have seen it ranges only in h1 to h6 then a  self closing tags like br and hr also seen various attributes of hr like size,color,align,noshaded,width</p>

    <p>
        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
        <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
        <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
        <h6>This is heading 6</h6>
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr size=3 noshade color="brown" width="75%" align="left">
    <p>Then done sherlock homes vala text on codepen and learnt about some tags</p>
